# What is this?
This is a basic Discord bot programmed in Python to be used by other programmers
as a barebones bot to be changed into the Discord bot of their choosing.

# How to run this project
Python 3.8 or higher is required.

discord.py is needed, the install instructions can be found here https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py (Without Full Voice Support)

You can clone the repo and run it in a text editor like Atom https://atom.io/ or possibly a
Python IDE, However, I'm not sure if the above download of discord.py will work for IDEs.

Going to the Discord Dev Portal (https://discord.com/developers/applications),
Follow this video for the rest (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nW8c7vT6Hl4)
